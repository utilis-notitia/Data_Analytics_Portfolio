# Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**! 

As a beginner data analyst, I am eager to showcase my skills in transforming data into actionable insights using **Tableau** and **Power BI**. This portfolio contains a collection of my  work, demonstrating my ability to turn complex data sets into visually appealing and informative reports. 

From exploratory data analysis to interactive dashboards, I aim to showcase the power of data visualisation in driving business decisions. 

Browse through my portfolio to get a taste of my work and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

You will find a selection of Tableau Dashboards on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aaronn" target="_blank">Aaron's Tablea Profile</a>

Recently I have been learning reporting in Power BI. I will be adding more Dashboards in due course. Find them in my <a href="https://github.com/utilis-notitia/PowerBI_Reports" target="_blank">Power BI Report Repository</a>
