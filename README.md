# Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**! 

As a beginner data analyst, I am eager to showcase my skills in transforming data into actionable insights using **Tableau** and **Power BI**. This portfolio contains a collection of my  work, demonstrating my ability to turn complex data sets into visually appealing and informative reports. 

From exploratory data analysis to interactive dashboards, I aim to showcase the power of data visualisation in driving business decisions. 

Browse through my portfolio to get a taste of my work and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

You will find a selection of Tableau Dashboards on [Aaron's Tableau Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aaronn)

Recently I have been learning reporting in Power BI. I will be adding more Dashboards in sue course. Find them in my <a href="[http://example.com/](https://github.com/utilis-notitia/PowerBI_Reports)" target="_blank">Power BI Reports Repository</a>
