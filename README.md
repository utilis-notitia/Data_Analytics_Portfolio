# Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**! 

As a beginner data analyst, I am eager to showcase my skills in transforming data into actionable insights using Tableau and Power BI. This portfolio contains a collection of my  work, demonstrating my ability to turn complex data sets into visually appealing and informative reports. 

From exploratory data analysis to interactive dashboards, I aim to showcase the power of data visualisation in driving business decisions.
